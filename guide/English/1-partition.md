### Backing up partitions
> If you don't do this and mess something up, you're on your own

#### Boot to EDL
- Open **Device Manager** on your PC
- With the phone turned off, hold **volume down** + **power**.
- After the screen turns dark, while still holding **volume down** + **power**, start rapidly pressing the **volume up** button.
- Keep doing this until you see **QDLoader 9008** or **QUSB_BULK** in the Device Manager on your PC.
- If the device has a ⚠️ yellow warning triangle, you need to install EDL drivers before you can continue to the next step.

#### Setting up Qfil
- Open **Qfil**.
- In "Select Build Type", select **flat build**.
- In "Select programmer", select the downloaded firehose.
- In Configuration, make sure the "Device Type" is set to **UFS**.

#### Backing up your partitions
- In **Qfil**, select Tools > Partition manager, and click **Ok**.
- Right click on **laf_a** > **Manage Partition Data** and press **Read Data**.
- Do the same thing for **laf_b**, **boot_a**, **boot_b**, **abl_a**, **abl_b**, **aop_a**, **aop_b**, **xbl_a**, **xbl_b**, **fsg**, **fsc**, **modemst1**, **modemst2**, **modem_a**, **modem_b**

> [!Important]
> Navigate to `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\Qualcomm\QFIL\COMPORT_#\` and rename the backed up partitions one by one as you back them up. Qfil does not name the backups, and if you don't rename them, it'll be impossible to figure out which files are which. You can restore them later with the **Load Image** function.

### Flashing engineering ABL
> If fastboot works on your phone, you can skip this step
- In **Qfil**, select Tools > Partition manager, and click **Ok**.
- Right click on **abl_a** > **Manage Partition Data** and press **Load Image**.
- Select and flash the **engabl_ab.bin** file.
- Do the same thing for **abl_b**.

#### Reboot your phone
> Hold **power** to reboot back to Android

#### Flash TWRP or Orange Fox
> Use the provided files and flash them in Magisk, then reboot to recovery
>
> If you have Lineage recovery, you can also use that instead

#### Unmount all partitions
Go to mount in TWRP/Orange Fox and unmount all partitions

### Preparing for partitioning
> Download the parted file and move it in the platform-tools folder, then run
```cmd
adb push parted /cache/ && adb shell "chmod 755 /cache/parted" && adb shell /cache/parted /dev/block/sda
```

#### Printing the current partition table
> Parted will print the list of partitions, **userdata** should be the last partition in the list.
```cmd
print
```

#### Removing userdata
> Replace **$** with the number of the **userdata** partition, which should be **30**
> 
> If you have a **grow** partition, remove it as well
```cmd
rm $
```

#### Recreating userdata
> Replace **19GB** with the former start value of **userdata** which we just deleted
>
> Replace **60GB** with the end value you want **userdata** to have
```cmd
mkpart userdata ext4 19GB 60GB
```

#### Creating ESP partition
> Replace **60GB** with the end value of **userdata**
>
> Replace **60.3GB** with the value you used before, adding **0.3GB** to it
```cmd
mkpart esp fat32 60GB 60.3GB
```

#### Creating Windows partition
> Replace **60.3GB** with the end value of **esp**
>
> Replace **126GB** with the end value of your disk, use `p free` to find it
```cmd
mkpart win ntfs 60.3GB 126GB
```

#### Making ESP bootable
> Use `print` to see all partitions. Replace "$" with your ESP partition number, which should be 31
```cmd
set $ esp on
```

#### Exit parted
```cmd
quit
```

#### Format all data
Go to the Wipe menu in TWRP, press Format Data, then type `yes`.

#### Check if Android still starts
Just reboot the phone and see if Android still boots.
