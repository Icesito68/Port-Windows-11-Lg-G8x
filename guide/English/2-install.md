# Running Windows on the LG G8x

## Installing Windows

### Prerequisites
- [Windows on ARM image](https://worproject.com/esd)
  
- [Drivers](https://github.com/Icesito68/Port-Windows-11-Lge-devices/releases/tag/Drivers)

- [Mass storage image](https://github.com/Icesito68/Port-Windows-11-Lge-devices/releases/download/Files/msc.img)

### Reboot to fastboot mode
- With your phone turned off, hold the **volume down** button, then plug the cable back in.
- If the phone in device manager is called **Android** and has a ⚠️ yellow warning triangle, you need to install fastboot drivers before you can continue.

#### Boot to the mass storage UEFI
> Replace **<path\to\msc.img>** with the actual path of the UEFI image
```cmd
fastboot boot <path\to\msc.img>
```

#### Enabling mass storage mode
> Once booted into the UEFI, use the volume buttons to navigate the menu and the power button to confirm
- Select **UEFI Boot Menu**.
- Select **USB Attached SCSI (UAS) Storage**.
- Press the **power** button twice to confirm.

### Diskpart
> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT ERASE ANY PARTITION WHILE IN DISKPART!!!! THIS WILL ERASE YOUR ENTIRE UFS!!!! THIS MEANS THAT YOUR DEVICE WILL BE PERMANENTLY BRICKED WITH NO SOLUTION! (except for taking the device to Xiaomi or flashing it with EDL, both of which will likely cost money)

```cmd
diskpart
```

#### Finding your phone
> This will list all connected disks
>
> Look for your phone (which should be the last disk which will be 117GB in size). If you do not see it, wait a few seconds and run the command again. Repeat this until you see the disk.
```cmd
lis dis
```

#### Selecting your phone
> Replace $ with the actual number of your phone
```cmd
sel dis $
```

#### Listing your phone's partitions
> This will list your device's partitions
```cmd
lis par
```

#### Selecting the Windows partition
> Replace $ with the partition number of Windows (should be 32)
```cmd
sel par $
```

#### Formatting Windows drive
```cmd

```cmd
dism /apply-image /ImageFile:<path\to\install.esd> /index:6 /ApplyDir:X:\
```

> If you get `Error 87`, check the index of your image with `dism /get-imageinfo /ImageFile:<path\to\install.esd>`, then replace `index:6` with the actual index number of Windows 11 Pro in your image

### Installing drivers
> Unpack the driver archive, then open the `OfflineUpdater.cmd` file
